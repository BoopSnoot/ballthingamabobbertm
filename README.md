# Ball Thingamabobber™
Want a game to waste 5 minutes of your precious time? Well, here it is! Meet the MARVELOUS-ish "Ball Thingamabobber™"

Created by a 16-year-old trying to learn Unity, it was made for no other reason, but to make the creator (dats me haha i no s+ and djaba) feel not like a complete failure in programming.
